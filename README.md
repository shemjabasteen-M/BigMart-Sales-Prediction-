The BigMart Sales Prediction is a popular data science problem that involves predicting the sales of products at various stores. It is typically structured as a regression problem where the goal is to predict the sales of individual products based on certain features. This dataset is often used in hackathons and machine learning competitions, such as those hosted on platforms like Kaggle.


The goal is to predict the Item_Outlet_Sales (dependent variable) based on various independent features like:

Item_Identifier: Unique product ID.
Item_Weight: Weight of the product.
Item_Fat_Content: Whether the product is low-fat or regular.
Item_Visibility: The percentage of total display area allocated to the product in all stores.
Item_Type: The category to which the product belongs (e.g., dairy, soft drinks, meats, etc.).
Item_MRP: Maximum Retail Price (price of the product).
Outlet_Identifier: Unique store ID.
Outlet_Size: Size of the store (Small, Medium, Large).
Outlet_Location_Type: Location type of the store (e.g., Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 3 cities).

Outlet_Establishment_Year: The year when the store was established.
